# Trinity Core Build 7.3.5.26972
TrinityCore built with CMake. You still need to compile it using any C++ compiler.
# Description (from official repo)
TrinityCore is a MMORPG Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from MaNGOS, the Massive Network Game Object Server, and is based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
